# Thyroid-Cancer-Recurrence-Prediction
A machine learning algorithm to predict the recurrence of thyroid cancer among the patients.
### It is very common for Thyroid Cancer to reccur. It can happen within a few months after getting the treatment.
#### About 98.5%Trusted Source of people with thyroid cancer will survive for at least 5 years. However, survivors of this disease have an increased riskTrusted Source of developing another cancer, and about 20%Trusted Source are at risk of a thyroid cancer recurrence.
#### Some people have a higher riskTrusted Source of thyroid cancer recurrence. Factors that can increase the risk of a recurrence include:
<ul>
<li>being over 45 years of age at diagnosis</li>
<li>having had cancer that spread beyond the thyroid</li>
<li>being male</li>
<li>having certain tumor genes</li>

### In this project, our aim is to use the previous available datasets that record the reccurence of thyroid cancer in already treated patients.
### The following are the attributes of the Dataset.
##### Variables:
<ul>
<li>Age: Integer Data</li>
<li>Gender: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Smoking: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Hx Smoking: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Hx Radiothreapy: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Thyroid Function: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Physical Examination: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Adenopathy: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Pathology: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Focality: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Risk: Categorical Data</li>
<li>T: Categorical Data</li>
<li>N: Categorical Data</li>
<li>M: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Stage: Categorical Data</li>
<li>Response: Categorical Data</li>

##### Target Variable:
<ul>
<li>Recurred: Categorical Data.</li>
</ul>

#### The project is carried out in two files.
#### The main.ipynb file which is a jupyter notebook which consists the machine learning model and the analysis of the Data.
#### The test.ipynb jupyter notebook used to test the accuracy of the machine learning model.
